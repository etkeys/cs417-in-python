-Included in the root directory is the Makemat application.

-Please compile and run USING THE RELEASE CONFIGURATION. If you use the DEBUG
	configuration there will be a bunch of DEBUG and TRACE garbage, which slows
	down execution and may give the illusion of being in an infinite loop.

-The program expects 2 files that contain the definitions of matrix "A" and "b".
	These files must be named "A.def" and "b.def" respectively. These files must
	be placed in the "files" sub-directory.
