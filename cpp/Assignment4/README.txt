Power method and Newton Method solvers:

This program was made as an assignment for CS417 Spring 2018.

-Run this program in USING THE RELEASE CONFIGURATION. If you use the DEBUG configuration,
	there will be a bunch of debug and trace garbage.

-The program requires as input 1 text file that is the definition of a matrix. The file
	must be named "A.def". This file is to be placed in the "files" sub-directory.
	
-At a certain point, there doesn't seem to be a solution, at least not with the matrices
	I tested with. I was able to get a 5x5 matrix to run but when I tried a 9 and 10, the
	program just runs indefinetly. I let it run for an hour and a half with a 9x9 and it
	didn't complete. I even tried to use a calculator to confirm if my program was made
	incorrectly, but even a German calculator ran indefinetly. Perhaps my matrices were
	not idea for this application, but it seemed that there was too much entropy.
